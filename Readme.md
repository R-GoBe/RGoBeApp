# R-GoBe App
Mobile Application for R-GoBe developed with App Inventor and Appy Builder. (block programming).  
This the R-GoBe App first implemented in [App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu) using [ai2](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu).  
But, there are a lot of limitations so we migrate to [Appy Builder](http://appybuilder.com/) using [gold](http://gold.appybuilder.com/) because that offers more components and advances features to improve the app.
